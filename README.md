# Face-Recognition-Web-App-using-One-Shot-Learning-with-Siamese-Networks
The model replicates what is shown in the paper titled Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition. Used Tensorï¬‚ow 2 with data augmentation technique, OpenCV &amp; streamlit.

# Goal
Goal is to construct and train the Neural network by applying one shot learning approach. Finally create a Face Recognition web application using streamlit. We can also deploy this app to any cloud service at end.
# Steps to be taken
These are the following steps to be taken to reach our goal. We will see them on by one.
  
  3.1. Virtual Environment Setup
  3.2. Install & Import Dependencies
  3.3. Collect Dataset
  3.4. Data Augmentation
  3.5. Loading and Preprocessing Data with TensorFlow Data API
  3.6. Create Labeled Dataset
  3.7. Data Preprocessing- Resize and Rescale
  3.7. Split the Dataset for Training and Testing
  3.8. Defining Model Architecture
  3.9. Compile the Model
  3.10. Customize Training Steps
  3.11. Evaluate Model
  3.12. Prediction
  

# final web app will look like this
